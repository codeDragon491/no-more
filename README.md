# Tailwind CSS with Webpack Starter and Vue.js quick try Project 

This is an example of a super simple static webpage built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). It also required a very small amount of Javascript, so for that reason I have used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). 
Since the focus of the project is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), I didn´t installed [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and I didn´t focus on [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) file/folder structure at all. I only used the CDN version of it for a quick try out.

In order to easily use [Tailwind CSS] I have setted up Webpack Starter.

To get started, clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
# Using npm
npm install

After that, start up Webpack:

```
npm run watch
```

Webpack will watch `/src/styles.css` and `/tailwind.js` and rebuild your stylesheet on every change.

You can play around with `/index.html` to see the effects of your changes.
